# Contributing to DanceSuite

First off, thank you for considering contributing to DanceSuite! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community!

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into DanceSuite itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing bug reports to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. When you are creating a new bug report, please provide a clear and concise description of the bug, and include as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
6.  Open a pull request.

## Code Style

We use Prettier for code formatting. Please run `npx prettier --write .` before committing your changes.
